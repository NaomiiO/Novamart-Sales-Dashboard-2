- Project Summary

Novamart has been in business for over four years, but like many stores with a wide product mix, it lacked clarity on which products and customers were truly driving profit. This interactive dashboard was built to uncover what’s working, what’s not, and where the business can grow smarter—not just bigger.

Using Excel, I explored 4 years of sales data to spot profit gaps, unproductive products, and high-value customer groups. The goal was simple: Turn data into decisions that increase revenue and reduce waste.

- Business Problem
Novamart needed visibility into its performance beyond just “sales.”
Too many products, unclear profit drivers, and minimal targeting of its most valuable customers led to missed growth opportunities.

- Key Question:
“Which products and customers are actually profitable, and how can we use that to grow smarter?”

- Insights Delivered
300+ products had zero sales—indicating excess or poor stock selection

Products under $150 made up a huge portion of inventory but just 3% of profit

Customers aged 50+ delivered the highest profit per person

Black and red product colors consistently outperformed others

- Business Value
Revenue Growth: Focus on high-performing products and customers

Cost Reduction: Remove non-selling products from inventory

Efficiency: Realign promotional strategy to what actually works

- Tools & Skills Used
Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)
